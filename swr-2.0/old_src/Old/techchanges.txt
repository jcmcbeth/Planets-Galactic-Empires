- Rewrote the algorithm for calculating how much shields are drained.
- You will not be allowed to perform an action that will take you below less than 5% fuel.
- Shields will no longer drop if you do not have enough power, the will drain as if autorecharge was off.
- A warning is now displayed if cloaking is about to fail because of low energy.

  galaxy.  Now it applies to how many asteroids can be in a system.
